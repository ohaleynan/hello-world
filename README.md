New To Programming &amp; Linux

Just finished "The Linux Command Line" book and am now starting "Mastering VIM".
Working on an old Dell Precision M4800 that had Windows 7, now running Ubuntu.
Have just upgraded and waiting for delivery on a System76 Oryx Pro running pop_os.
Any further reading subject suggestions appreciated. This is more a hobby than work.
Thanks in advance.
